Merchant acquiring is a critical component of the payment processing industry, enabling merchants to accept electronic payments from their customers. A merchant acquirer is a company or financial institution that provides payment processing services to merchants. The merchant acquirer acts as a middleman between the merchant and the card-issuing bank, facilitating the processing of credit and debit card transactions. The merchant acquirer is responsible for collecting, verifying, reconciling the transaction details, and depositing the funds into the merchant's account. In exchange for these services, the merchant acquirer charges the merchant a fee, which may include a percentage of the transaction amount and a per-transaction fee."

        "text": "Address Verification Service (AVS) is a fraud prevention tool used in the payment processing industry to verify the billing address of a credit cardholder. The purpose of AVS is to help merchants and acquirers confirm that the person making the purchase is the cardholder and prevent fraudulent transactions.AVS works by comparing the billing address provided by the cardholder during the transaction to the address on file with the card issuer. If the addresses match, the transaction goes through. The transaction may be declined or subject to further review if the addresses do not match.AVS is typically used for card-not-present transactions, such as online or over the phone, where the cardholder's physical presence is not confirmed. AVS can be an effective tool for reducing fraud in these types of transactions, as it helps to verify the cardholder's identity. Some sample AVS responses and their meanings are as follows:'Y' or 'M' - Match: The billing address provided by the customer matches the address on file with the card issuer.'N' - No Match: The billing address provided by the customer does not match the address on file with the card issuer.'A' or 'Z' - Partial Match: The billing address provided by the customer partially matches the address on file with the card issuer. This can occur if the customer's address is abbreviated or if the postal code is missing.'U' or 'W' - Unavailable or Not Verified: The card issuer's system was unable to verify the billing address provided by the customer. This can occur if the card issuer does not support AVS or if the customer's card was issued outside of the country.€"

Arbitration aims to provide a quicker, more cost-effective, and less formal method of resolving disputes than going to court. In arbitration, the arbitrator makes a binding decision after considering evidence and arguments from both parties. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding and can only be overturned in limited circumstances."

        "text": "Credit card authorization is obtaining approval for a credit card transaction. It is a vital step in the payment processing cycle as it helps ensure the cardholder has sufficient funds available to complete the transaction and helps prevent fraudulent activity. When a buyer purchases a credit card, the merchant submits a request to their acquirer for authorization. The acquirer then sends the request to the card issuer, which checks the cardholder's account to see if sufficient funds are available to cover the transaction. If the card issuer approves the transaction, it sends an authorization code back to the acquirer, which passes it on to the merchant. The authorization code confirms that the transaction can proceed and the merchant can complete the sale.If the card issuer does not approve the transaction, it sends a decline message to the acquirer, which passes it on to the merchant. In this case, the transaction cannot proceed, and the cardholder may need another payment method."

The following is a general outline of the chargeback process:Dispute filling: The cardholder contacts the issuing bank and disputes a transaction, usually because of a problem with the product or service received, or because the transaction was unauthorized.Investigation: The issuing bank investigates the dispute, gathers information from the cardholder (and sometimes from the merchant), and determines whether a chargeback is warranted.Chargeback filing: If the issuing bank determines that a chargeback is justified, it debits the merchant's account for the amount of the disputed transaction and credits the cardholder's account.Representment: The merchant may dispute the chargeback and provide compelling evidence to support their position. If the evidence is convincing, the issuing bank may reverse the chargeback.Arbitration: If the issuing bank and merchant cannot resolve the dispute, the case may be sent to arbitration, where an independent party will make a final decision.Final outcome: Based on the results of the investigation and representation, the chargeback is either granted or denied, and the funds are adjusted accordingly.Note: The exact process and timeline may vary depending on the card network (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) and the country in which the transaction took place."

        "text": "Chargebacks TRUE cost refers to the apparent and hidden costs associated with chargebacks to your business. These costs range from the chargeback fees to the inventory fees as highlighted below.Card transaction chargeseCommerce merchants are charged a specific percentage for every card transaction a cardholder makes. And if the cardholder goes on to charge back the transaction, the merchant does not get a refund on the card processing fee €“ they lose that money with the cost of the merchandise.Chargeback feesWhen a cardholder files a chargeback, the merchant acquirer also includes additional charges for their involvement in the mediation processes. The fee could be in the range of $20 to $100 and calculated based on the level of associated risks, i.e., the number of chargebacks the merchant received in a given period. Chargeback fees are non-negotiable for the most part, whether you win the dispute or lose.Excessive chargeback penaltiesBanks and card networks pay keen attention to merchants' chargeback rates to ensure they don't cross established thresholds. When the merchant enters the €œhigh risk€ category, the fees become astronomical. Excessive chargeback penalties can range from $5000 to $25,000.High cost of operation and brand damageChargebacks don't just take money away from your pocket. They also cost online merchants time, human resources, and brand equity. These are, perhaps, the most expensive aspects of dealing with eCommerce chargebacks. No one will do business with you if you cannot maintain a reasonable fidelity as a formidable brand in the industry. Banks can't work with you because they'll see your brand as high risk, and even if they happen to take your business, they'll make you pay excessive fees to cushion their risks and future reputational crisis.Inventory and overhead costseCommerce transactions involve several distinct deliverables, such as pick-up, packaging, warehousing, and shipping. These activities also involve costs. And when a scammer relieves you of the transaction revenue with a false chargeback, these overhead costs also affect your balance sheet. Inventory management expenses often represent about 20% of an average merchant's losses due to chargebacks."

For a chargeback to be winnable, the merchant must have documentation supporting the transaction's validity and refuting the cardholder's claim. This evidence may include receipts, invoices, shipping records, customer communications, and other documentation that supports the transaction.The key to a winnable chargeback is providing a clear and concise chargeback response that outlines a complete picture of the transaction and the evidence backing it. This response should be well-structured, easy to comprehend and address all vital points in the chargeback reason code."
